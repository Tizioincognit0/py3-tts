`py3-tts` is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, **it works offline**.

## Installation

```shell
pip install py3-tts
```

> If you get installation errors, make sure you first upgrade your wheel version using

```shell
pip install --upgrade wheel
```

### Linux installation requirements

+ If you are on a linux system and if the voice output is not working,

  Install `espeak`, `ffmpeg` and `libespeak1` as shown below

  ```shell
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install espeak ffmpeg libespeak1
  ```

## Features

- ‚ú®Fully **OFFLINE** text to speech conversion
- üéà Choose among different voices installed in your system
- üéõ Control speed/rate of speech
- üéö Tweak Volume
- üìÄ Save the speech audio as a file
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Simple, powerful, & intuitive API

## Usage

```python
import pyttsx3

engine = pyttsx3.init()
engine.say("I will speak this text")
engine.runAndWait()
```

**Single line usage with speak function with default options**

```python
import pyttsx3

pyttsx3.speak("I will speak this text")
```

**Changing Voice, Rate and Volume**

```python
import pyttsx3

engine = pyttsx3.init()  # object creation

""" RATE"""
rate = engine.getProperty('rate')  # getting details of current speaking rate
print(rate)  # printing current voice rate
engine.setProperty('rate', 125)  # setting up new voice rate

"""VOLUME"""
volume = engine.getProperty('volume')  # getting to know current volume level (min=0 and max=1)
print(volume)  # printing current volume level
engine.setProperty('volume', 1.0)  # setting up volume level  between 0 and 1

"""VOICE"""
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')  # getting details of current voice
# engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id)  #changing index, changes voices. o for male
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)  # changing index, changes voices. 1 for female

engine.say("Hello World!")
engine.say('My current speaking rate is ' + str(rate))
engine.runAndWait()
engine.stop()

"""Saving Voice to a file"""
# On linux make sure that 'espeak' and 'ffmpeg' are installed
engine.save_to_file('Hello World', 'test.mp3')
engine.runAndWait()

```
